# Tasks and their descriptions


## Sigmoid neurons simulating perceptrons, part I

### Task

Suppose we take all the weights and biases in a network of perceptrons, and multiply them by a positive constant, $c>0$. 
Show that the behaviour of the network doesn't change.

### Python script `ex_0_sigmoid`
