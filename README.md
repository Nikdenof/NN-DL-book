# Neural Networks and Deep Learning exercises with Python

This repo is made to showcase my solutions for exercises featured in [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/index.html) book.

Each chapter has its own readme that describes the exercises and the scripts.
